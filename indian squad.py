# Function to calculate ages of players
def calculate_ages(total_age):
    # Let the age of players X and Y be 'a'
    # Age of player Z will be 'a + 10'
    # Total age equation: a + a + (a + 10) = total_age
    # Simplifying: 3a + 10 = total_age
    # Therefore: 3a = total_age - 10 => a = (total_age - 10) / 3
    
    a = (total_age - 10) // 3
    age_x = age_y = a
    age_z = a + 10
    
    return age_x, age_y, age_z

# Input the total age of the three players
total_age = int(input("Enter the total age of the 3 players: "))

# Get the ages
age_x, age_y, age_z = calculate_ages(total_age)

# Output the ages
print(age_x)
print(age_y)
print(age_z)
